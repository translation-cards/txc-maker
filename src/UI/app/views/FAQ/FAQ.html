          What should I have ready before using TXC Maker?
        </div>
        <p>
        You should have two documents ready before using the TXC Maker:
          <ul>
            <li>An excel template with all the deck content. You can copy
              <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AZoI5z_BPuJevtmclW0RCMFE4cJnKFvN1nlkpjdZL_k/edit?usp=sharing">this excel template</a>
              and fill out a line for every translation you'd like to make.
              <ul>
                <li>Under the Language heading you should fill out the iso code for the language you'd like to use not the language itself.
                  Not sure what the iso code is for your language? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes">Check here</a>.
                  <br/>For example if the language for my translation is Spanish, I would fill out 'es' under the language column for that translation.
                </li>
                <li>Write the english phrase to be translated in the 'label' column</li>
                <li>The translation column should hold the translated phrase in the language you filled out</li>
                <li>Finally, put the name of the translation audio recording under the filename column</li>
                <li> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ug7jEJB3a0zE3pNdNkE1MIAXS5-3ldBS35hhO-HgYto/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a>
                  you can view an example of a filled out sheet that is in use for the default deck in the application.
                </li>
                <li>Make sure you save your spreadsheet or import it into google drive</li>
              </ul>

            </li>
            <li> A folder in your Google drive with all your audio files containing the recorded translations for your deck.</li>
          </ul>

        </p>

        Using TXC Maker
        </div>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Navigate to deck import to get to the deck import page.</li>
            <li>Input the name of your deck, and the publisher name (organization name or author of deck).</li>
            <li>Under the document ID input the the portion after the last / of the URL containing your deck spreadsheet in google drive.
              <br/>For example if the URL with your spreadsheet looks like this 'https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0BzScrGiXtpD_dnBRZ1BOWms5dWM', you just need to input '0BzScrGiXtpD_dnBRZ1BOWms5dWM' under document ID.
            </li>
            <li>Similarly in the audio directory input the portion after the last / of the Google Drive URL containing all your recorded audio translation files.
            </li>
            <li>Select the license and whether you want to lock the deck (which means users will NOT be allowed to add, change, or remove translations from your deck).
            </li>
            <li>Finally, submit and wait for the deck maker to compose your deck into a TXC. It will catch any possible mistakes and show you on the following screen.
            </li>
            <li>If any errors are caught, they must be resolved before you can publish the deck.</li>
